# Login Page Demo Buttons Update

## ✅ Added Office Manager and Shop Manager Demo Buttons

### 🆕 New Demo Account Buttons

I've successfully added 2 new demo login buttons to the existing 3 buttons on the login screen:

#### **New Buttons Added:**

1. **Office Manager**
   - **Icon**: 👥 Users icon
   - **Role Value**: `office-manager`
   - **Destination**: `/dashboard` (shows Office Manager Dashboard)
   - **Description**: "Customer service & financial operations."

2. **Shop Manager**
   - **Icon**: ⚙️ Settings icon  
   - **Role Value**: `shop-manager`
   - **Destination**: `/dashboard` (shows Shop Manager Dashboard)
   - **Description**: "Production management & team oversight."

### 📋 Complete Demo Account List

The login page now shows **5 demo account buttons** in this order:

1. **Owner** - Shield icon - "Full access to all features."
2. **Office Manager** - Users icon - "Customer service & financial operations."
3. **Shop Manager** - Settings icon - "Production management & team oversight."
4. **Technician** - Hard Hat icon - "Access to assigned jobs & inventory."
5. **Customer** - Key icon - "View service history & messages."

### 🔧 Technical Implementation

**File Modified**: `src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx`

**Changes Made**:
1. Added `Users` and `Settings` icons to the import from `lucide-react`
2. Inserted Office Manager and Shop Manager entries into the `demoAccounts` array
3. Both new roles redirect to `/dashboard` and will show their respective specialized dashboards

### ✅ Testing Instructions

Users can now test the new management dashboards by:

1. **Go to**: `http://localhost:9002/login`
2. **Click**: "Office Manager" or "Shop Manager" demo button
3. **Result**: Automatically logs in and shows the specialized management dashboard

### 🎯 User Flow

```
Login Page → Click "Office Manager" → Office Manager Dashboard
Login Page → Click "Shop Manager" → Shop Manager Dashboard
```

Both buttons work seamlessly with the role-based dashboard system that was previously implemented, providing immediate access to the specialized management interfaces.
